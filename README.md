Testable Profile Card

Overview
This project implements a simple, accessible, and responsive Profile Card component using semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid), and vanilla JavaScript. The card displays user information including name, bio, current timestamp, avatar, social links, hobbies, and dislikes. Every visible element includes a data-testid attribute for easy automated testing.The design is mobile-first and adapts to different screen sizes: vertical stacking on small screens and a side-by-side layout (avatar left, content right) on larger screens.

Features
Semantic HTML: Uses <article>, <header>, <figure>, <nav>, <section>, and lists for better accessibility and SEO.
Accessibility: Includes alt text for images, keyboard-focusable links with visible focus styles, and ARIA-friendly structure.
Responsiveness: Breakpoints for mobile (<480px), tablet/desktop (≥768px).
Dynamic Timestamp: JavaScript updates the current time in milliseconds using Date.now().
Testable: All required elements have exact data-testid attributes (e.g., test-profile-card, test-user-name).
Social Links: Open in new tabs with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer".

Demo
Open index.html in a modern web browser to view the card. The timestamp will update on page load.Profile Card Preview <!-- Placeholder; replace with actual screenshot if available -->

TechnologiesHTML5: 

Semantic markup.
CSS3: Flexbox, Grid, media queries for responsiveness.
Vanilla JavaScript: For dynamic timestamp rendering.

No external dependencies or build tools required.

Setup

Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in a web browser.
(Optional) Replace the placeholder avatar URL in the <img> tag with a real image source.
(Optional) Customize content like name, bio, hobbies, etc., directly in the HTML.

For testing:
Use tools like Cypress, Jest, or Playwright to target elements by data-testid.
Example: cy.get('[data-testid="test-user-name"]').should('contain', 'John Doe');

Usage

The card is self-contained in a single HTML file. Embed it in any webpage or use as a standalone page.

Customization
Avatar: Update the src attribute of test-user-avatar. Supports URLs; for uploads, handle via JS (not implemented here).

Social Links: Add/remove <li> items in test-user-social-links with custom data-testid like test-user-social-<network>.

Content: Edit text in respective elements (e.g., test-user-bio).

Styling: Modify the <style> block for colors, fonts, etc.

Timestamp Update: The JS sets it once on load; extend the script for live updates if needed.

Testing
All elements are testable via
data-testid:Root: test-profile-card
Name: test-user-name
Bio: test-user-bio
Time: test-user-time (value should match Date.now() within ~100ms)
Avatar: test-user-avatar (must have alt)
Social Links: test-user-social-links (individual: test-user-social-twitter, etc.)
Hobbies: test-user-hobbies
Dislikes: test-user-dislikes

Automated tests can verify presence, content, accessibility (e.g., focusable links), and responsiveness.
