    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>Advanced CSS animations still trip me up—timing and performance tweaks feel like impossible. Also, optimizing javascript,with good task, hoped to improve better. I'm tackling these with deliberate practice and mentors feedback.</p>

      <p>Hey future me, remember: Progress isn't linear, but persistence is. keep on thriving, like that form that finally validates without rage-quits. Keep questioning, keep building— you're not just coding sites, you're shaping accessible futures. Stay inspired.</p>

      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This program has already shifted my mindset from "pixel-pushing" to "problem-solving with empathy." Excited for Stage 2: more complexity, more collaboration.</p>
